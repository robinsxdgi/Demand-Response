1) You can find code files from the above Github link. The codes were written in Python with Jupyter notebook, including 6 notebooks, named in a way like "PreferenceLearning-Part(N).ipynb", where N = 1, 2, 3, ..., 6.

2) It is suggested to use Jupyter notebook to open the code, since you will also see the visualizations and some comments along the figures.

3) In case you don't have Jupyter notebook, I also printed the pdf version of the codes and results (named in a same way as "PreferenceLearning-Part(N).pdf"). It is suggested that you download and then read instead of read them online, since each file could be a little bit large (totally around 800 pages of data analysis).
