# Consumer Groups' Price Responsiveness in Demand Response Market with Dynamic Pricing
This is an analysis of consumer groups' price responsiveness in demand response market with dynamic pricing, based on the time-series data of electricity prices, temperatures, and energy consumptions of 5000 London households over the year of 2013.


## The analysis includes 6 parts
### Part1: data preprocessing and seasonality (Simpson paradox phenomenon)
  
    Please see "PreferenceLearning-Part1.ipynb" or its pdf version "PreferenceLearning-Part1.pdf"
    
### Part2: consumer (with dynamic pricing) categorization based on PCA and K-mean clustering

### Part4: Consumer groups' price responsiveness in warm season

    "PreferenceLearning-Part4.ipynb /.pdf"
    
### Part5: consumer (without dynamic pricing) categorization based on PCA and K-mean clustering
