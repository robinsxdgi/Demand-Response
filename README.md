Two ways to see the code:

1. Jupyter notebook: download the code files, which include 6 notebooks named in the format "PreferenceLearning-Part(N).ipynb", where N = 1, 2, 3, ..., 6. Then open them in the Jupyter notebook, and you will also see the visualizations and some comments along the figures.


2. PDF versions: If you don't have Jupyter notebook, you can also download the pdf version of the codes and results, named in a same way as "PreferenceLearning-Part(N).pdf", where N = 1, 2, 3, ..., 6. It is suggested that you download and then read, instead of read them online, since each file could be a little bit large (around 800 pages of data analysis in total).
